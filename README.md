## Welcome

Welcome to my fullstack-project 'courses_', a multi-user application for students to handle your university courses and monitoring data such as average grade and total amount of credits.

## The idea

The idea is to have this application as a side project in combination with my studies as a M.Sc. student in CSE. The application both involves backend with a **Java Spring Boot** rest application to access as **Postgres** database and frontend using **React** with **Typescript** and **Bootstrap**. 

The application will support multiple users at the same time with high security using password encryption and JSON Web Tokens. 

Users will be able to have different roles, one being 'admin' whom can manage users, but without accessing sensetive data such as grades to respect user integrity.

Also a vast amount of focus will be put in the user experience and making sure that the application is fail proof for users of all levels.

## The plan

The plan is to start with implementing the user-part of the application, beginning with the backend. This is because the user-level is the highest of all, each user has courses, and each course has examinations. Beginning with e.g. courses and building a first prototype would lead to extra work.
