# Welcome

Welcome to my fullstack-project 'courses_', a multi-user application for students to handle your university courses and monitoring data such as average grade and total amount of credits.

# The idea

The idea is to have this application as a side project in combination with my studies as a M.Sc. student in CSE. The application both involves backend with a **Java Spring Boot** rest application to access as **Postgres** database and frontend using **React** with **Typescript** and **Bootstrap**. 

A vast amout of focus will be put in the user experience and making sure that the application is fail proof for users of all levels.
