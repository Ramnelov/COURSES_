      <h2>Welcome</h2>

      <p>
        Welcome to my fullstack-project 'courses_', a multi-user application for
        students to handle your university courses and monitoring data such as
        average grade and total amount of credits.
      </p>

      <h2>The idea</h2>

      <p>
        The idea is to have this application as a side project in combination
        with my studies as a M.Sc. student in CSE. The application both involves
        backend with a <b>Java Spring Boot</b> rest application to access as
        <b>Postgres</b> database and frontend using <b>React</b> with
        <b>Typescript</b> and <b>Bootstrap</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The application will support multiple users at the same time with high
        security using password encryption and JSON Web Tokens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users will be able to have different roles, one being 'admin' whom can
        manage users, but without accessing sensetive data such as grades to
        respect user integrity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also a vast amount of focus will be put in the user experience and
        making sure that the application is fail proof for users of all levels.
      </p>

      <h2>The plan</h2>

      <p>
        The plan is to start with implementing the user-part of the application,
        beginning with the backend. This is because the user-level is the
        highest of all, each user has courses, and each course has examinations.
        Beginning with e.g. courses and building a first prototype would lead to
        extra work.
      </p>
